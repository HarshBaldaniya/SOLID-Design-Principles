# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Superheroes at Work

## What is ISP?

The **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** is a design principle that states no class should be forced to implement methods it doesn’t need. Instead of using one large interface with many methods, you should divide it into smaller, more specific interfaces. This allows classes to only implement what they actually use.

## Why ISP?

By applying ISP, you keep your code modular and flexible. If you have a large interface that includes methods not relevant to all classes, it leads to bloated code. ISP helps avoid this problem by creating specific, targeted interfaces that different classes can implement according to their own needs.

## Example Explanation (Superheroes at Work)

In this example, different superheroes have different abilities:
- **Superman** can fly and lift heavy objects.
- **Aquaman** can swim and also lift heavy objects.
- **Flash** can only lift heavy objects.

Instead of forcing all superheroes to implement one large interface containing methods for flying, swimming, and lifting, we break it down into smaller interfaces (for flying, swimming, and lifting). Now, each superhero implements only the abilities they need, keeping the code clean and focused.


Real-Life Use of ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) in Tech
Scenario: Building a Payment System

Imagine you're developing a payment system for an e-commerce website. You need to handle various payment methods like credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency. Each payment method requires different operations, but if you create one large interface with methods for all payment types, you'll end up forcing every payment provider to implement methods they don’t need.

For example:

PayPal doesn’t need credit card validation.
Cryptocurrency doesn’t require handling PayPal-specific logic.
By using ISP, you split the large "PaymentProcessor" interface into smaller, more specific interfaces, like CreditCardProcessor, PayPalProcessor, and CryptoProcessor. Now, each payment method implements only the methods relevant to them, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

Why it's useful in tech: This is commonly used in modular systems where different components (payment gateways, authentication methods, etc.) need to handle only what's relevant to them without unnecessary code. This makes it easier to expand the system in the future when new payment methods need to be added.
