# Indian Cooking System with SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

## Overview
This project simulates a **traditional Indian cooking system** for a **village feast**, demonstrating the implementation of **SOLID Principles** and **Factory Design Pattern** using a practical scenario. The system manages both dishes and their recipes in a modular and extendable way.

---

## Features
1. **Multiple Cooking Methods**:
   - Implements various cooking styles like `TandoorCooking`, `ChulhaCooking`, and `KadhaiCooking`.
2. **Dish Recipes**:
   - Dishes like `Khichdi` and `Paneer Butter Masala` include detailed ingredients and preparation steps.
3. **Dynamic Cooking**:
   - Cooking methods can be dynamically switched at runtime.
4. **Extensible and Maintainable**:
   - Easily add new dishes and cooking styles without modifying existing code.

---

## SOLID Principles
### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- **Example**:
  - The `Dish` class focuses solely on representing a dish and its recipe.
  - The `VillageHead` class manages the preparation and delegation of cooking tasks.

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Definition**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Example**:
  - New dishes (e.g., `DumAlooDish`) can be added by creating new classes without modifying the existing code.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Definition**: Subclasses should be replaceable with their parent class without breaking the system.
- **Example**:
  - Any subclass of `Dish` (e.g., `KhichdiDish`, `PaneerButterMasalaDish`) can replace `Dish` without issues.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Definition**: A class should not be forced to implement methods it does not use.
- **Example**:
  - The `Cooking` interface defines only one method (`cookDish`), keeping it focused and relevant.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- **Example**:
  - The `VillageHead` depends on the `Cooking` interface, not specific implementations like `TandoorCooking`.

---

### Design Patterns
**Design patterns** are reusable solutions to common software design problems. This project demonstrates:

1. **Factory Pattern**:
   - **Definition**: A creational design pattern that provides a method to create objects without specifying their exact class.
   - **Example in the Code**:
     - The `DishFactory` dynamically creates `Dish` objects based on the dish name.

2. **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
   - **Definition**: A design pattern where a class receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself.
   - **Example in the Code**:
     - Spring Framework injects `Cooking` implementations into `VillageHead` at runtime.

---

## Features
- **Multiple Cooking Styles**: Implements various cooking methods like `TandoorCooking`, `ChulhaCooking`, and `KadhaiCooking`.
- **Dynamic Cooking**: The cooking method can be changed at runtime.
- **Extensible and Maintainable**: Adheres to SOLID principles and allows easy addition of new features.

## How It Works
1. **Define Abstraction**: 
   - The `Cooking` interface defines a common contract for all cooking methods.
2. **Implement Abstraction**:
   - Concrete classes like `TandoorCooking`, `ChulhaCooking`, and `KadhaiCooking` implement the `Cooking` interface.
   - The `Dish` class holds both the name and recipe details for dishes.
   - Subclasses (e.g., `KhichdiDish`, `PaneerButterMasalaDish`) provide specific ingredients and steps.
3. **Inject Dependencies**:
   - The `VillageHead` depends on the `Cooking` interface, and Spring injects the required implementation at runtime.
4. **Dynamic Cooking**:
   - The `VillageHead` uses `Cooking` implementations (e.g., `TandoorCooking`, `ChulhaCooking`) to prepare dishes.
   - The cooking method can be dynamically switched using the `setCookingMethod` method.
